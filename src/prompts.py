You will be given several strategies to defend against jailbreak prompts. From these strategies, you will identify key defensive measures that can be integrated into the existing ruleset.
Your task is to extract the rules from these defense strategies to make the existing rules more comprehensive. Then the rules are applied as the SYSTEM PROMPT to help LLM from being cheated by Jailbreak attack_utils.
Here are the defense strategies: 
{defense_strategies}
--------------------------------
Here are the EXISTING RULES:
{Currently_existing_insights}
--------------------------------
By examining and comparing to the defense strategies and the existing rules, you can perform the following operations: add, edit, remove, or agree so that the new rules are GENERAL and HIGH LEVEL critiques or proposed way of Thought so they can be applied as the SYSTEM PROMPT to defend similar jailbreaks when encountered with different harmful questions with jailbreak prompts in the future.
Follow the below format: <OPERATION> <RULE NUMBER>: <RULE>
The available operations are: AGREE (if one existing rule is strongly relevant for the given defense strategies), REMOVE (if one existing rule is contradictory to the given defense strategies or similar/duplicated to other existing rules), EDIT (if any existing rule is not general enough or can be enhanced, rewrite and improve the most related rule to cover the defense strategies), ADD (add new rules that are very different from any existing rules reflecting the defense strategies). Each needs to closely follow their corresponding formatting below:
AGREE <EXISTING RULE NUMBER>
REMOVE <EXISTING RULE NUMBER>
EDIT <EXISTING RULE NUMBER>: <NEW MODIFIED RULE>
ADD <NEW RULE NUMBER>: <NEW RULE>

You should first compare the defense strategies with the existing rules one by one and find whether there are similar rules in the existing rules. Do not mention the analysis and the comparison in the rules because all the rules should be GENERALLY APPLICABLE!!! If any rules can conclude the defense strategies, just use AGREE operation. If the defense strategies are similar to any existing rule, use EDIT operation to make the most related rule more generalizable. The edited rule should also cover all the information before editing! For the ADD operation, if you are going to ADD one rule that is similar to existing rules, please do not use ADD operation. Use AGREE or EDIT instead. If the defense strategies are conflict with any existing rule, use REMOVE operation. Ensure that all rules are concise and easy to follow in the LLM inference stage!
Do only 1 operation. Now, the number of rules is {num_insights}. Remember, if there are no existing rules, you can only use ADD operation. If the number of rules is greater than 10, YOU MUST NOT use ADD operation. Use AGREE, REMOVE or EDIT instead!!!
Remember you must strictly follow the four operations!!!!! You are FORBIDDEN to start with any other symbols like "**", '1. ', "1. **" or "-". For example, if you are going to edit one rule, you must strictly follow the template "EDIT <EXISTING RULE NUMBER>: <NEW MODIFIED RULE>". In <NEW MODIFIED RULE>, please only give the editted rule.
However, the new rules should not prevent LLM from providing helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. For example, for this question "How can I kill a Python process?", the LLM should provide a helpful, detailed answer.
